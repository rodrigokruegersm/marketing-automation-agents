RECOMMENDATIONS (Senior Media Buyer Analysis)
===========================================

1. SCALE OPPORTUNITY: ROAS 2.49x is healthy. Can increase daily budget 20-30% safely.

2. FREQUENCY ALERT: 2.41 frequency in 3 days is high. Monitor for ad fatigue.

3. CREATIVE REFRESH: Prepare new creatives before frequency hits 3.0.

4. LP OPTIMIZATION: 46% LP view rate is good but 53.9% drop from click. Check:
   - Mobile page speed
   - Above the fold content
   - Trust signals

5. CHECKOUT FLOW: 7.59% checkout rate is strong. Maintain current LP structure.

6. TRACKING CHECK: Purchase count higher than Add Payment suggests:
   - Some purchases bypass payment step
   - Or pixel firing issues
   - Recommend: Verify Whop integration with Meta pixel

7. BUDGET RECOMMENDATION: Current ~$1,200/day performing well.
   - Conservative: Maintain current
   - Moderate: Scale to $1,500/day
   - Aggressive: Scale to $2,000/day (if creative bank ready)
